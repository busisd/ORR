Old Reddit Redirect - Chrome extension that automatically redirects you from www.reddit.com to old.reddit.com

The reason that I made this is that I prefer the old version of reddit, as it makes it easier to find the content you're interested in. The default website is the new version, so this extension makes it so that Chrome will automatically redirect you without having to hunt down the link or change the URL manually.
